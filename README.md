# BiteLens: An Image Recognition Application for Nutritional Tracking and Dietary Management

BiteLens is an advanced Android application that leverages the power of image recognition and machine learning to assist users in tracking their nutritional intake and managing their diet effectively. The app uses Firebase's ML Kit for food image recognition, Firestore database for data storage, Firebase Authentication for user management, and Nutritionix API for accurate nutrition data. Users can add meals by simply taking photos or choosing from their gallery, and the app identifies the food and provides detailed nutritional information. BiteLens also provides statistics to help users monitor their dietary habits and make informed dietary decisions.
